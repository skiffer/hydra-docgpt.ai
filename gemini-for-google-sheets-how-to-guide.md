## Advanced Tips and Best Practices

### Optimizing Your Prompts

1. **Be Specific**: Include exact formatting requirements and output structure
2. **Use Context**: Reference multiple cells for comprehensive analysis
3. **Set Parameters**: Specify tone, length, or style requirements
4. **Iterate**: Test prompts on small samples before scaling up

### Managing API Costs

1. **Batch Operations**: Use ranges to process multiple items efficiently
2. **Cache Results**: Save outputs to avoid re-processing identical data
3. **Monitor Usage**: Track API consumption in the add-on dashboard
4. **Optimize Prompts**: Clear, concise prompts are more cost-effective

### Performance Optimization
