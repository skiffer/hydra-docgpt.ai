[NOTE: positive prompt is the required prompt to fed into the model, while negative prompt is anything to exclude from the prompt, to avoid the model considering it]

- **Negative prompt** must include the following (you can add suggested keywords additionally based on your understanding above):

- Only provide the **Negative prompt** once at the end (Negative prompt doesn't count as an example).
