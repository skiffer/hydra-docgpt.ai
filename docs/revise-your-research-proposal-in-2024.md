# Revise Your Research Proposal in 2024

### Case of usage:
> Generate a topic-based research proposal in a minute

## Prerequisites

Before starting the tutorial, make sure you have the following ready to use these prompts in Google Sheets for batch results:

- **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms Add-on**: Installed from the [GPT for Google Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/u/0/marketplace/app/gpt_for_sheets_docs_forms_slides/466607203252).

## Enabling GPT Functions

If you cannot see the GPT functions in your spreadsheet, follow these steps to enable them:

1. Go to **Extensions** in the menu.
2. Navigate to **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms**.
3. Select **Launch**.


### Prompt for GPT in Google Sheets:
```shell
# Research Proposal Writer

I want you to act as a research proposal writer. I will provide you with a general research topic and you will need to write a proposal outlining the specific focus of the research in [TARGETLANGUAGE], the research questions that will be addressed, and the methods that will be used to conduct the research. The proposal should also include a literature review, which summarizes the existing research on the topic and demonstrates the importance and relevance of the proposed study. The proposal should be well-written and should clearly convey the value and potential contributions of the proposed research.
[PROMPT]
```

Use following formula inside GPT for Sheets
> =GPT(prompt)

### Also you can try with others AI models Claude, Mistral, Perplexity, Gemini
Here some examples for calling this models in Google Sheets:

> =CLAUDE(prompt)
> =MISTRAL(prompt)
> =GEMINI(prompt)
> =PERPLEXITY(prompt)


### Try also SERP() function for getting top keywords, titles for a Google Search query in Google Sheets

Get top ranked pages for docgpt.ai:
