## Use cases for ChatGPT within Google Sheets

### Writing and improving copy for SEO
When you're looking to improve existing content or generate new ideas that can boost your search engine rankings, the ChatGPT Sheets integration can be revolutionary.

With GPT for Sheets, SEO copywriting becomes streamlined through straightforward prompts. For instance, you can enhance large volumes of existing content to better adhere to SEO best practices. For instance, an SEO specialist could utilize a formula such as

> =GPT("Optimize this title for SEO", A2) 

where A2 contains a less-than-optimal headline. ChatGPT then returns a suggestion for a more impactful, keyword-optimized headline based on SEO trends and data. Dragging the formula down then applies it to the whole column.
