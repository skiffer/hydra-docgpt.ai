[TARGETLANGUAGE]  
Write website copy for the homepage using the keyword. The first section is Hero Section. Capture the visitor's attention here. The headline should identify what they need and explain how it can make their lives better if they have it. It should include a call to action. Building a StoryBrand is about making your customer the hero of a story. The Seven Big Ideas The customer is the hero, not your brand. Companies tend to sell solutions to external problems, but customers buy solutions to internal problems. Customers aren’t looking for another hero; they’re looking for a guide. All copy should position, not call, the customer the hero directly but make them feel like they found the guide they need so they can be the hero, without saying they are the hero.

Section 2 is the Problem Section. Briefly write this section using the keywords while also stating what their problem is. Do not write how to solve it. This section is to empathize and acknowledge the struggle they are facing. Highlight how they might feel. Include the same call to action from section 1.

Section 3 is the Value Section. Highlight a few bullet points to show the value of choosing this company as their guide. Show them what they can achieve and how they will feel after being guided successfully. Include the same call to action.

Section 4 is the Guide Section. As a company, position yourself as a guide to help your customers solve their problems and win. By doing this, customers are likely to do business with you because they know you are helping them win. Always remember that it is not about you or the business; it is all about the customers. In this section, tell them about yourself and quickly transition to your empathy and authority. Don't talk about yourself, just your empathy and authority. Show how you are similar to them and how they can trust you.

Section 5 is the Plan Section. Provide three easy and simple steps for your customer to follow.  
Step 1: What they need to do. This can be “Signing up”  
Step 2: What they will get.  
Step 3: What they will achieve.

Section 6 is the Call to Action Section. This is the same call to action used throughout the entire homepage. This is a sales or pricing section in which you list what your customers will get, followed by a "BUY NOW" button at the end. Most customers want to see what’s on the product before buying, so this section is beneficial to your homepage. Moreover, ensure that there are scattered CTA buttons all over the landing page so that when a customer decides to buy a product, they don’t have to search for it.

The final section is the Junk Section. Use this section to place other important things you feel are needed for your homepage. But make sure not to overcrowd it. If you are redeveloping your website and need additional content, this is the place where you can put it.
