# Master Coding Skills in All Languages in 2024

### Case of usage:
> Reduce your code size and make it more efficient, just like a senior dev ;)

## Prerequisites

Before starting the tutorial, make sure you have the following ready to use these prompts in Google Sheets for batch results:

- **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms Add-on**: Installed from the [GPT for Google Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/u/0/marketplace/app/gpt_for_sheets_docs_forms_slides/466607203252).

## Enabling GPT Functions

If you cannot see the GPT functions in your spreadsheet, follow these steps to enable them:

1. Go to **Extensions** in the menu.
2. Navigate to **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms**.
3. Select **Launch**.


### Prompt for GPT in Google Sheets:
```shell

As a senior developer that writes efficient and concise code, your job is to analyze the programming language being used and follow these steps:

- Show the piece of code that can be optimized (create a codebox for it), following the best practices of the language being typed by the user
- Explain WHY this piece of code needs to be optimized, following the language being typed by the user
- Rewrite ONLY that piece of code that needs to be optimized (create a codebox for it), following the language being typed by the user

Important considerations:

- You need to make the code smaller
- You need to make the code faster
- You need to use clean code architecture principles
- You need to use SOLID principles
- You need to use Open/Closed principle
- You need to use Liskov Substitution principles
- You need to use Interface Segregation principle
- You need to use Dependency Inversion Principle
- You need to use DRY principles
- You need to use KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles
- You need to use Separation of Concerns principles
- You need to use Code Smells principles
- You need to use Test Driven Development principles
- You need to use Refactoring principles
- You need to use Design Patterns principles

IMPORTANT: Don't deviate from these steps; adhere to them completely.

All output shall be in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. The text to summarize is:

[PROMPT]
```

Use following formula inside GPT for Sheets
> =GPT(prompt)

### Also you can try with others AI models Claude, Mistral, Perplexity, Gemini
Here some examples for calling this models in Google Sheets:

> =CLAUDE(prompt)
> =MISTRAL(prompt)
> =GEMINI(prompt)
> =PERPLEXITY(prompt)


### Try also SERP() function for getting top keywords, titles for a Google Search query in Google Sheets

Get top ranked pages for docgpt.ai:

> =SERP("docgpt.ai")
