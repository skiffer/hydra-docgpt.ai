# Optimize Fiverr Gig for Freelance Services in 2024

### Case of usage:
> Make a fiverr GIG including: Title, Thumbnail, Video description Script, Gig Description and Packages (Price, informaiton....) with one [KEYWORD]

## Prerequisites

Before starting the tutorial, make sure you have the following ready to use these prompts in Google Sheets for batch results:

- **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms Add-on**: Installed from the [GPT for Google Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/u/0/marketplace/app/gpt_for_sheets_docs_forms_slides/466607203252).

## Enabling GPT Functions

If you cannot see the GPT functions in your spreadsheet, follow these steps to enable them:

1. Go to **Extensions** in the menu.
2. Navigate to **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms**.
3. Select **Launch**.


### Prompt for GPT in Google Sheets:
```shell
When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, "perplexity" and "burstiness." Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the content I am going to ask you to create, it needs to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness.

Based on the knowledge you have on Fiverr, generate the following content for a Fiverr gig in [TARGET LANGUAGE], based on these keywords [PROMPT]:

1. **Catchy Titles**: Generate at least two human-made, highly catchy, and attention-grabbing titles. Each should be 70 characters or less; the shorter, the better, formatted as: "I will..."

2. **Thumbnail Images**: Describe at least three images that could be used as the gig thumbnail, emphasizing their appeal.

3. **Video Script**: Provide a script for an explanatory video of the gig. The video should be precise and optimized to attract consumer attention from the first frame.

4. **Package Details Table**: 
   - Create three different packages: Basic, Standard, and Premium.
   - Highlight what makes them different. Example: Basic is $10 for a simple task, whereas Premium is $200 but offers more.
   - Each package should have at least four bullet points and specify the price. Basic should not exceed $150, Standard not over $350, and Premium priced appropriately for the service offered.
   - Use bullet points to describe the packages, highlighting their selling points.

5. **Description**: Create a description based on the keywords that is attention-grabbing, well-punctuated, and formatted with bullet points and headers to effectively reach and convince customers.

6. **Optimized Keywords**: Generate five optimized keywords, each with a maximum of 20 characters, to enhance reach and relate to the gig.

7. **FAQ**: Develop a FAQ section to help customers thoroughly understand the gig.

8. **Requirements**: List the requirements customers should provide to facilitate the work.

The tone should always be as if written by an individual freelancer and not a team or business. Thank you for your attention, and please apply all the instructions carefully.
