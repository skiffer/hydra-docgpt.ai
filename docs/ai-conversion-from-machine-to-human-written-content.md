# AI Conversion: From Machine to Human-Written Content

### Case of usage:
> Rewrite AI Content to Human Written Content and Bypass AI Detector 

## Prerequisites

Before starting the tutorial, make sure you have the following ready to use these prompts in Google Sheets for batch results:

- **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms Add-on**: Installed from the [GPT for Google Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/u/0/marketplace/app/gpt_for_sheets_docs_forms_slides/466607203252).

## Enabling GPT Functions

If you cannot see the GPT functions in your spreadsheet, follow these steps to enable them:

1. Go to **Extensions** in the menu.
2. Navigate to **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms**.
3. Select **Launch**.


### Prompt for GPT in Google Sheets:
```shell
I am going to give you some information before asking you to write an article.
When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, "perplexity" and "burstiness." Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness.
Using the concepts written previously, rewrite this article with a high degree of perplexity and burstiness : [PROMPT] in [TARGETLANGUAGE]

## Benefits of AI Conversion: From Machine to Human-Written Content

AI conversion technology, which transforms machine-generated text into human-written content, offers several notable advantages that can enhance the overall quality and impact of textual content. Firstly, it ensures that the generated content is more nuanced and contextually relevant, which can improve user engagement and satisfaction. Human-like text is typically better at conveying emotions, subtleties, and cultural context that purely machine-generated text may miss. Secondly, this transformation increases the readability and relatability of the content, making it more accessible to diverse audiences. Additionally, human-style writing can improve the reliability and trustworthiness of the content, crucial for maintaining credibility in academic, journalistic, or professional contexts. Another significant benefit is the optimization of SEO (Search Engine Optimization). When AI-generated content is meticulously converted to human-like text, it tends to perform better on search engine ranking algorithms, which favor content that demonstrates higher quality and user engagement metrics. Finally, it frees up valuable time for human writers by stepping in to handle initial drafts or extensive writing tasks while still maintaining a high level of quality, allowing them to focus on more strategic and creative aspects of their work. In summary, AI conversion from machine to human-written content enriches text quality, fosters better engagement, and enhances SEO performance.
