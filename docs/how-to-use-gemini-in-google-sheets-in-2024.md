# How to use Gemini in Google Sheets in 2024


Knowing how to use Google Gemini can give you a deeper understanding of how AI works. Gemini is Google's answer to ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, and it's an upgraded version of the earlier experimental chatbot Bard.

Built on the advanced Gemini AI models, it's constantly being updated with new features like image generation and the ability to run code.

Originally a text-only chatbot, Gemini is now a full-fledged Google product, integrated into Google Workspace, Android, and also available as a standalone tool.

While Gemini is impressive, it's still a work in progress and can make mistakes or generate some strange responses. However, it's a big improvement over the earlier Bard models.

Gemini comes in both free and paid Advanced versions. The free version lets you create images, write stories, compile to-do lists, and even generate code. Let's dive into how to sign up for Google Gemini and how to use it once you're set up.

## Before You Start

Integrating Gemini with Google Sheets enables you to handle thousands of cells simultaneously. By prompting Gemini with your instructions, the Sheets add-on executes them, neatly organizing the output in rows and columns. Additionally, using the familiar Google Sheets interface eliminates the need to switch between different apps. Google Sheets is already excellent for teamwork, allowing real-time collaboration. With the Gemini for Sheets add-on, this collaboration becomes even more productive.
