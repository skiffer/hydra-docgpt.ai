If you cannot see the GPT functions in your spreadsheet, follow these steps to enable them:

3. Select **Launch**.


### Prompt for GPT in Google Sheets:
```shell
# Lines starting with # are only comments for humans
Write a 100% unique, creative, and human-written article in [TARGETLANGUAGE] for the keyword "[PROMPT]". Use the On Page SEO concept when writing articles. The article should include:

- Creative Title (should be in H1 Heading)
- SEO meta description
- Introduction
- Headings (should be H2 heading)
- Subheadings (H3, H4, H5, H6 headings)
- Bullet points or numbered list (if needed)
- FAQs

Ensure the article is plagiarism-free. The minimum length of the article should be 700 words. Don't forget to use a question mark (?) at the end of questions. Try not to change the original [PROMPT] while writing the title. Use "[PROMPT]" 2-3 times in the article and include it in headings as well.

Firstly, AI-driven tools streamline the content creation process by analyzing and incorporating relevant keywords, thus ensuring the article aligns with current search engine algorithms to boost rankings. Crafting precise meta descriptions automatically enhances search engine results page (SERP) appeal, as concise and compelling descriptions can significantly increase click-through rates by providing users with a snapshot of the article's value. Additionally, integrating FAQs within the content not only improves SEO by addressing common user queries but also enriches user experience by offering comprehensive, readily accessible information. Moreover, AI ensures consistency and accuracy in tone and style, vital for maintaining brand voice across multiple platforms. By utilizing AI for SEO article writing, businesses can save time and resources, allowing them to focus on strategic planning and other critical operations.
