# How to create Gemini API Keys in 2024


Hello everyone! In this tutorial, I'll walk you through the process of generating a Gemini API key absolutely free. This key allows you to access Gemini, an AI model similar to GPT, for content generation tasks. Unlike traditional AI models that often require paid subscriptions, Gemini is currently in beta and does not cost anything to use.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you meet the following requirements:
- You must be in a country where Google AI Studio and Gemini are available. Currently, Gemini is accessible in the US and several other countries, but not yet in Europe.
- If you're not in a supported country, you'll need to use a VPN to change your IP address to an American one. I recommend Express VPN, which offers a 30-day free trial. You can cancel anytime for a full refund if you're not satisfied.
- Installing Gemini for Google Sheets

1. **Visit the [Gemini for Sheets Add-On](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/gpt_for_docs_sheets_forms_slides/466607203252){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} on the Google Workspace Marketplace.**
2. **Click on "Install".**
