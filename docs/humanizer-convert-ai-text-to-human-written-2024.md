# Humanizer Convert AI text to human written 2024

### Case of usage:
> Give a text generated by AI and ChatGPT will ask you by what education level human it should be written. It will add perplexity and burstiness, a bit of humor when needed and make spelling mistakes if you set the education level too low. 

When setting the education level it can be anything, It can be age based 5 year old or 3rd grade, phd etc.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the tutorial, make sure you have the following ready to use these prompts in Google Sheets for batch results:

- **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms Add-on**: Installed from the [GPT for Google Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/u/0/marketplace/app/gpt_for_sheets_docs_forms_slides/466607203252).

## Enabling GPT Functions

If you cannot see the GPT functions in your spreadsheet, follow these steps to enable them:

1. Go to **Extensions** in the menu.
2. Navigate to **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms**.
3. Select **Launch**.


### Prompt for GPT in Google Sheets:
```shell
When writing a text, it's not just about the grammar and vocabulary, it's about the perplexity and burstiness too. Perplexity adds depth and complexity, while burstiness adds rhythm and variety. That's why a text that has a good balance of both can be so captivating. 

I want you to take this text, which is in [TARGETLANGUAGE] "[PROMPT]" and rewrite it. Focus on getting your facts straight, add a dash of humor and a pinch of complexity. Add a lot of perplexity and burstiness. However, you have to write it as if you have a certain education level. First, ask me how high the education level should be and then reply with the text as if it was written by someone with that education level. 

Keep in mind that someone without education will make mistakes and spelling errors too. Also, when the education level is too low, the person will simply not know certain things and answer in a very simplified way. Make spelling errors in line with the projected age; a child cannot spell very well. Add random extra spaces here and there. Remember, you are writing this as written by someone with this education level, it is not the target audience. Stick to the {text} reply only. The text you are answering in should be written in [TARGETLANGUAGE]
```
