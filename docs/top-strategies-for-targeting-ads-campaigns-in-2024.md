Input the product name and location country provided by the user. Then Analyze the ad libraries to identify the best-performing ad sets for the target audience based on factors such as ad type, format, placement, and copy. Use natural language processing to identify the key characteristics of the target audience, including age, gender, demographics, interests, and location. Provide Age Limit sets, Gender Sets, Demographics, Interests, Specific Time Period ad should run or not run on (if applicable), Locations cities wise to create the target audience for the ad campaign. Use search engine data to identify people in the location country who have recently searched for the product name. This will form one of the target audience sets for the ad campaign. Use competitor website data to identify people in the location country who have recently visited websites of competitors of the product name. This will form another target audience set for the ad campaign. Use ecommerce website data to identify people in the location country who have recently made a purchase on an ecommerce website related to the product name. This will form another target audience set for the ad campaign. Use online forum or community data to identify people in the location country who have shown interest in similar products to the product name. This will form another target audience set for the ad campaign. Incorporate behavioral data and psychographic information to enhance audience targeting, considering factors like lifestyle, values, attitudes, and personality traits. Analyze social media data to identify key influencers and trendsetters within the target location, who can be approached for promotional activities or partnerships. For each target audience set, consider creating personalized ad content and messaging to resonate more effectively with their preferences and needs, improving the chances of engagement and conversion. Perform A/B testing on different ad variations, including headlines, visuals, and calls-to-action, to optimize ad performance and gain insights on what resonates best with each target audience set. Consider incorporating retargeting strategies to re-engage potential customers who have shown interest but have not yet converted, using dynamic ads and personalized messaging.

Recommend two daily ad budgets and durations, one with the name "For Small Business" (should be equals to or lower than 10$(provide in local currencies)) and the other with the name "For Brands," based on historical ad performance data, target audience characteristics, and campaign goals. Use historical performance data and machine learning algorithms to estimate the optimal ad duration for the campaign to achieve the desired results. Use machine learning algorithms to recommend the best time period for running the ads based on target audience behavior and preferences. This can include factors such as days of the week, times of day, and time zones. Provide more than one ad set if possible. For each ad set, specify the ad placement platform (e.g., Google Ads, Facebook Ads , Instagram Ads, Tiktok Ads, LinkedIn Ads, Twitter Ads, Pinterest Ads) based on the most relevant platform for the target audience identified. Consider utilizing programmatic advertising and real-time bidding to optimize ad placements and reach the right audience segments more efficiently. For each ad set, also include ad formats (e.g., image, video, carousel, story, collection) best suited for the respective ad placement platform and target audience preferences. Monitor ad performance and engagement metrics regularly, adjusting campaign strategies and ad sets as needed to improve overall results. Output the four ad sets with their respective target audiences and ad placement platforms, along with recommendations for the target audience, daily ad budgets with two labels; First Label "For Small Business:" (should be equals to or lower than 10$(provide in local currencies)) and with Second Label "For Brands:" (i.e high budgets etc), optimal ad duration, and time period for running the ads. Must provide Ads Budget in the local currency according to the provided area, location or country.
