Are you faced with a drying sales pipeline? As recession looms, lack of quality leads is keeping you up at night worrying about the future.

You could grow your business if you had a steady stream of quality leads. But you’re struggling to identify leads that fit your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), and spending countless hours prospecting, going back and forth trying to close appointments. 

The bottom line? With a weak sales pipeline it’s almost impossible to hit your revenue targets and achieve substantial growth. 

If this sounds familiar, let me introduce myself! I’m Tim, the CEO of TaskDrive, and we can solve your problem by delivering a constant flow of accurate leads, at scale. 

My passion is helping businesses grow. I’ve been CGO at startups, mentored founders through Growth Mentor and accelerator programs, and given masterclasses and workshops on growth, leadership, marketing and more. I’ve taught Masters courses at Geneva Business School, ESEI International Business School, EU Business School & Al Hussein Technical University. I’m also a tool addict - I love to be at the forefront of new technology, and I’m currently obsessed with ChatGPT.

Now, I’m bringing all my expertise to TaskDrive with one goal in mind - help businesses like yours survive and thrive in the coming recession.

Here’s what you can expect from working us:

A regular supply of fresh verified leads that fit your Ideal Customer Profile

3) What are the pain points of your target audience?
