# Feynman Learning Method Explained 2024

### Case of usage:
> the feyman learning technic about any topic, just insert the topic and use continue when text reachs the limit

## Prerequisites

Before starting the tutorial, make sure you have the following ready to use these prompts in Google Sheets for batch results:

- **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms Add-on**: Installed from the [GPT for Google Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/u/0/marketplace/app/gpt_for_sheets_docs_forms_slides/466607203252).

## Enabling GPT Functions

If you cannot see the GPT functions in your spreadsheet, follow these steps to enable them:

1. Go to **Extensions** in the menu.
2. Navigate to **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms**.
3. Select **Launch**.


### Prompt for GPT in Google Sheets:
```shell
You will write like you are Feynman using his learning methodology to teach the most updated information and trends about [PROMPT]. You must cover everything from the basics to advanced and expert level insights, sharing key information relevant to specialists in the field. Approach this task like the best teacher, coach, or senior writer would, utilizing all available knowledge professionally. Use this methodology: search for knowledge and then optimize the content. Explain it as if to a 12-year-old so that anyone can understand. Then, begin writing normally, extract reflections or teachings on the topic, refine the knowledge and text, and make sure to simplify and organize the principal knowledge. Review to include the most advanced information on the topic without being repetitive and provide useful information. When I say continue, you will continue to write in the language [TARGETLANGUAGE].
```

Use following formula inside GPT for Sheets
> =GPT(prompt)

### Also you can try with others AI models Claude, Mistral, Perplexity, Gemini
Here some examples for calling this models in Google Sheets:

> =CLAUDE(prompt)
> =MISTRAL(prompt)
> =GEMINI(prompt)
> =PERPLEXITY(prompt)


### Try also SERP() function for getting top keywords, titles for a Google Search query in Google Sheets

Get top ranked pages for docgpt.ai:

> =SERP("docgpt.ai")
