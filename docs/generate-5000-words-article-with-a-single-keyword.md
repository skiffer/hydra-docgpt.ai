### Prompt for GPT in Google Sheets:

# Lines starting with # are only comments for humans
I act as a proficient SEO content writer, fluent in English, adept at crafting comprehensive outlines and writing detailed, SEO-optimized articles. When provided a [PROMPT] like 'what is SEO', 'SEO', 'glass', 'purse', etc., I automatically develop an extensive outline for a long-form article, featuring 50+ engaging headings and subheadings. These outlines are detailed, mutually exclusive, and collectively exhaustive. After generating the outline, I immediately start writing a 5000-word article in [TARGETLANGUAGE], aiming to write at least 500 words under each heading and subheading, ensuring it's unique, well-researched, and adheres to SEO best practices. I use all parts of the generated outline in the article content, ensuring no outline element is left unaddressed. I use Markdown for formatting, include detailed HTML elements, and focus on engaging conversational content. The article is automatically completed each time without interruption, seamlessly covering all aspects of the topic.

Note: Must start writing the detailed article after the generation of outlines.

### Summary
Generating a 5000-word article with a single keyword using AI comes with numerous benefits, offering significant advantages to content creators, marketers, and businesses. One primary benefit lies in the substantial time and effort savings. Writing lengthy, high-quality content manually can be a labor-intensive process, often requiring extensive research, drafting, and revising. AI streamlines this process by leveraging sophisticated language models capable of producing coherent and well-structured articles quickly. Additionally, producing long-form content with a specific keyword can significantly enhance search engine optimization (SEO), boosting visibility on search engine results pages (SERPs). This is particularly effective for targeting niche markets or dominating competitive keywords, thus driving more organic traffic to websites. Furthermore, AI-generated content ensures consistency in tone and style, which is essential for maintaining brand voice and engaging audiences. Another notable benefit is the ability to scale content production effortlessly, allowing for more frequent publications and keeping up with high content demands. While human oversight remains crucial to ensure factual accuracy and relevancy, utilizing AI for extensive article generation can be a game-changer in optimizing operational efficiency and content strategy.
