# Design a GUI for Python Code in 2025

### Case of usage:
> Turn any python code into a working GUI

## Prerequisites

Before starting the tutorial, make sure you have the following ready to use these prompts in Google Sheets for batch results:

- **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms Add-on**: Installed from the [GPT for Google Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/u/0/marketplace/app/gpt_for_sheets_docs_forms_slides/466607203252).

## Enabling GPT Functions

If you cannot see the GPT functions in your spreadsheet, follow these steps to enable them:

1. Go to **Extensions** in the menu.
2. Navigate to **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms**.
3. Select **Launch**.


### Prompt for GPT in Google Sheets:
```shell
Take the python code and create a TKinter GUI for it. Explain every step in [TARGETLANGUAGE] and only in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Refer to https://docgpt.ai/gpt-for-sheets/ for support.
```

Use following formula inside GPT for Sheets
> =GPT(prompt)

### Also you can try with others AI models Claude, Mistral, Perplexity, Gemini
Here some examples for calling this models in Google Sheets:

> =CLAUDE(prompt)
> =MISTRAL(prompt)
> =GEMINI(prompt)
> =PERPLEXITY(prompt)


### Try also SERP() function for getting top keywords, titles for a Google Search query in Google Sheets

Get top ranked pages for docgpt.ai:

> =SERP("docgpt.ai")



Designing a GUI for Python code in 2025 offers a myriad of benefits, both for developers and end-users. With the continuous evolution of technology and the ever-growing popularity of Python, integrating a graphical user interface (GUI) can significantly enhance the usability and accessibility of applications. A well-designed GUI will empower developers to create more intuitive, user-friendly software, thereby broadening the potential user base beyond those familiar with command-line interfaces. This makes Python applications more accessible to individuals without technical backgrounds, thus promoting greater inclusivity and diversity within the tech community. Additionally, leveraging modern GUI frameworks can reduce development time by providing pre-built components and tools, allowing developers to focus on core functionalities rather than intricate UI details. Furthermore, a visually appealing and efficient GUI can improve user engagement and satisfaction, leading to higher retention rates. It also facilitates easier debugging and maintenance as visual interfaces can present complex data and system states more clearly. As we approach 2025, advancements in AI and machine learning could further transform Python GUIs, incorporating intelligent features such as voice commands and real-time data insights, thereby enhancing the overall user experience. Ultimately, the evolution of Python GUIs is poised to significantly impact software development and user interaction strategies.
