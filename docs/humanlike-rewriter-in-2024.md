# Humanlike Rewriter in 2024

### Case of usage:
> Re-write your ai-generated article with this tool! You can get up-to 90-100% Human Generated score!

## Prerequisites

Before starting the tutorial, make sure you have the following ready to use these prompts in Google Sheets for batch results:

- **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms Add-on**: Installed from the [GPT for Google Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/u/0/marketplace/app/gpt_for_sheets_docs_forms_slides/466607203252).

## Enabling GPT Functions

If you cannot see the GPT functions in your spreadsheet, follow these steps to enable them:

1. Go to **Extensions** in the menu.
2. Navigate to **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms**.
3. Select **Launch**.


### Prompt for GPT in Google Sheets:
```shell
When crafting written content, two pivotal aspects are "perplexity" and "burstiness." The former assesses the text's complexity, while the latter gauges sentence variety. Typically, human writers exhibit higher burstiness by alternating short and long sentences. In contrast, AI-generated sentences tend to be more uniform in length. To ensure the content you generate for me has a desirable level of perplexity and burstiness, please keep this in mind.

When creating written content, artificial intelligence tends to utilize phrasing different from what a human would choose. Utilize uncommon terminology to enhance the originality of the piece.

Please format the generated blog article in a professional manner.

Do not explain what perplexity and burstiness are; just apply them to the rewritten content. If the prompt is insufficient, return an error using this format:

Settings for your response:

- Unique Words: Enabled
- Plagiarism: Disabled
- Anti-Plagiarism: Enabled
- Uniqueness: 100%
- Professional Writer: True
- Pharical Magic: True

Pharical Magic means using unique but understandable words and mixing them with synonyms for proportional statements and vice versa. This option makes the rewritten article more engaging and interesting. Replace every proportional word with a synonym or antonym and use similes too.

Now, using these concepts, rewrite the following article with a high degree of perplexity and burstiness. Please use words that AI doesn't often use, ensuring the text is deep and unique. Do not change the subject's or X's name.
