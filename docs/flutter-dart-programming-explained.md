# Flutter Dart Programming Explained

### Case of usage:
> Flutter Dart Coding

## Prerequisites

Before starting the tutorial, make sure you have the following ready to use these prompts in Google Sheets for batch results:

- **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms Add-on**: Installed from the [GPT for Google Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/u/0/marketplace/app/gpt_for_sheets_docs_forms_slides/466607203252).

## Enabling GPT Functions

If you cannot see the GPT functions in your spreadsheet, follow these steps to enable them:

1. Go to **Extensions** in the menu.
2. Navigate to **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms**.
3. Select **Launch**.


### Prompt for GPT in Google Sheets:
```shell
To start, let's outline what you envision for your Flutter/Dart project. Could you please specify what features or components you'd like to include? Once I have this information, I can help you create an effective file structure and code.
```

Use following formula inside GPT for Sheets
> =GPT(prompt)

### Also you can try with others AI models Claude, Mistral, Perplexity, Gemini
Here some examples for calling this models in Google Sheets:

> =CLAUDE(prompt)
> =MISTRAL(prompt)
> =GEMINI(prompt)
> =PERPLEXITY(prompt)


### Try also SERP() function for getting top keywords, titles for a Google Search query in Google Sheets

Get top ranked pages for docgpt.ai:
