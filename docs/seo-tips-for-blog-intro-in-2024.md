# SEO Tips for Blog Intro in 2024

### Case of usage:
> Create a best, SEO Optimised and Engaging Introduction part for your blog posts by pasting your main keyword or blog title.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the tutorial, make sure you have the following ready to use these prompts in Google Sheets for batch results:

- **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms Add-on**: Installed from the [GPT for Google Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/u/0/marketplace/app/gpt_for_sheets_docs_forms_slides/466607203252).

## Enabling GPT Functions

If you cannot see the GPT functions in your spreadsheet, follow these steps to enable them:

1. Go to **Extensions** in the menu.
2. Navigate to **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms**.
3. Select **Launch**.


### Prompt for GPT in Google Sheets:
```shell
Please ignore all previous questions. Your new task is to write the blog post introduction in the [TARGETLANGUAGE] using the following [PROMPT]. The introduction should consist of only three paragraphs, with each paragraph containing a maximum of 3 to 4 sentences. 

The first paragraph must incorporate the [PROMPT] and include an engaging question to captivate the reader's interest. The second paragraph should provide a concise summary of the article in three sentences. For example, if the article is about "Greatest Batsmen," describe it like, "Sachin, with 100+ centuries and over 30K career runs, is truly the greatest batsman of all time. Indian batsmen Sourav Ganguly and Virat Kohli follow with 15k and 12k runs, respectively."  

The third paragraph should entice the reader to explore the full article by employing hooks such as, "But these are not the only three batsmen we have in this year’s ranking. So, without any further ado, let’s jump into the realm of the greatest batters the world has ever seen this year." Make the content valuable and trustworthy by referencing a famous subject matter expert on the [PROMPT].  

Ensure active sentence structures and avoid excessive use of common transition words like “Besides,” “however,” “moreover,” “additionally.” Aim for variety. 

Sentences should be concise. If a sentence is lengthy, break it into two for clarity. Avoid repeating sentences, as repetition can disengage readers. 

Provide accurate data; do not include nonsensical information. For example, when writing about “American Football” as America’s most-watched sport, use data, stats, viewership numbers, TV ratings, etc. Avoid unsubstantiated claims.  

Keep paragraphs short and information-rich to maintain reader interest, ensuring each paragraph does not exceed three sentences.  

Craft crisp, focused sentences without unnecessary words. Clearly convey your message.  

Engage your audience by posing questions to make your article interactive. For example: "Tell us your thoughts!" or "Don’t you think so?"
