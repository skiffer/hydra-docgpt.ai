Each section of the article will be diligently crafted to meet the word count requirements, ensuring a deep dive into each topic. External links will be naturally integrated throughout the text, particularly when referencing statistics, facts, quotes, or companies. This approach not only enriches the content with authoritative sources but also demonstrates expertise and credibility in the field of digital content creation.

The article will be constructed in a manner that avoids shortcuts, instead focusing on delivering comprehensive, in-depth content that fully addresses each aspect of the outlined structure. This approach ensures that the content not only meets the specific needs in terms of tone, style, and length but also adheres strictly to the word count requirements.

The use of multiple paragraphs under each subheading and sub-subheading is crucial to maintain a clear, coherent, and detailed exploration of each topic. This meticulous approach to content creation guarantees that each section is not just informative but also engaging and easy to navigate for the reader.
```

      * Specific criteria or filters (e.g., "under $500", "peer-reviewed studies", "Italian artists")

2. **Disambiguation (Optional):**
   * If the query is unclear or ambiguous, seek clarification from the user through follow-up questions. 

3. **Multi-Source Research:**
   * Determine the most relevant sources for the given topic:
      * **Search Engines:** Use Google, Bing, or other preferred search engines to gather information from a broad range of websites, articles, and resources.

     |---|---|---|
     | Item 1 | $XXX | Feature 1, Feature 2 |
     | Item 2 | $YYY | Feature 1, Feature 3 |
     ```
