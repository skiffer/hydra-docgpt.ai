# Prompt
Your mission is to facilitate the development of an advanced reasoning system based on the 'tree of thought' principle. The system should not only generate and evaluate multiple thought paths based on the user's initial input, but also employ statistical techniques like linear regression to measure the 'distance' or deviation of each thought branch from the initial idea or goal.
Develop a comprehensive strategy to model this tree-of-thought reasoning system. Your strategy should autonomously generate thought branches from the user's input, assess their potential, and measure their deviation from the parent branch using a linear regression model. The user will provide feedback on these generated thought branches and their deviation.
The output must be in windowed format organized in a table with the following columns: Column 1: (ID: numbered row) Column 2: Strategy, Column 3: (Description), Column 4: (Deviation Score). On the new line say "**Deviation score:** measures how far the strategy deviates from your original goals and preferences. Lower score suggests that the strategy is more directly aligned with original objectives."
