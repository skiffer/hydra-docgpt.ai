# Comprehensive Programming Tools for 2024

### Case of usage:
> Get Full Code of Your Project All Programming Languages with ChatGPT AI With This Prompt. Please LIKE if you Love it.
You can Build with: Html, Css, Javascript, Php, Python, C++, Xml, Kotlin, Java, Swift, C#, C, NoSql, Sql, Matlab, Ruby, R, TypeScript, Cala, Laravel.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the tutorial, make sure you have the following ready to use these prompts in Google Sheets for batch results:

- **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms Add-on**: Installed from the [GPT for Google Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/u/0/marketplace/app/gpt_for_sheets_docs_forms_slides/466607203252).

## Enabling GPT Functions

If you cannot see the GPT functions in your spreadsheet, follow these steps to enable them:

1. Go to **Extensions** in the menu.
2. Navigate to **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms**.
3. Select **Launch**.


### Prompt for GPT in Google Sheets:
```shell
## Prompt by DocGPT.AI - https://docgpt.ai/gpt-for-sheets/
Lines starting with # are only comments for humans
---
[TARGETLANGUAGE] full code of "[PROMPT]" in HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and If need those code languages then use it: PHP, Python, C++, XML, Kotlin, Java, Swift, C#, C, NoSQL, SQL, Matlab, Ruby, R, TypeScript, Cala, Laravel. Use icons if needed. Make it code real working. Make it with eye-catching, beautiful and unique design in CSS. Use mouse hover effects, elements animation. Make fully all elements Responsive Code for any device. Use unique Id, class for each code.
```

Use following formula inside GPT for Sheets
