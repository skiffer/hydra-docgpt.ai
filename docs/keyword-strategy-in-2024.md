I will give you the target keyword [PROMPT].  
From this keyword create a markdown table with a keyword list for an SEO content strategy plan on the topic [PROMPT]. 
Cluster the keywords according to the top [VARIABLE2] super categories and name the super category in the first column called keyword cluster. 
Add in another column with [VARIABLE2] subcategories for each keyword cluster or specific long-tail keywords for each of the clusters. 
List in another column the human searcher intent for the keyword. 
Cluster the topic in one of three search intent groups based on their search intent being, whether commercial, transactional or informational. 
Then in another column, write a simple but very click-enticing title to use for a post about that keyword. 
Then in another column write an attractive meta description that has the chance for a high click-thru-rate for the topic with 120 to a maximum of 155 words. 
The meta description shall be value based, so mention value of the article and have a simple call to action to cause the searcher to click.
