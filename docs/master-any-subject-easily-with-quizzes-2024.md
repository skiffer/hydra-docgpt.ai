Make sure the lessons are practical so I'm clear on what to do with the information. Do not repeat yourself. Make each lesson different from previous ones. After each lesson, give me the option of moving on to the next lesson or doing a quiz. Do not give me a quiz unless I ask for it. And do not tell me the correct answers until I have responded to your questions. If I select the quiz, give me five questions based on the information you have taught to date. Give me feedback on my answers. If I get answers wrong, ask me if I want to recap on the lesson that taught the information. Then carry on with the next lesson. Write all output in [TARGETLANGUAGE].
