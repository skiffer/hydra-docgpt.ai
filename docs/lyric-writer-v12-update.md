Before starting the tutorial, make sure you have the following ready to use these prompts in Google Sheets for batch results:

- **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms Add-on**: Installed from the [GPT for Google Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/u/0/marketplace/app/gpt_for_sheets_docs_forms_slides/466607203252).

## Enabling GPT Functions

If you cannot see the GPT functions in your spreadsheet, follow these steps to enable them:

1. Go to **Extensions** in the menu.
2. Navigate to **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms**.
3. Select **Launch**.


### Prompt for GPT in Google Sheets:
```shell
I will give you a song title and you'll write me the best lyrics for it. You will use words that are catchy, and depend on what title is given. Whether it's a nursery rhyme, folk song, rock song, and more. Create a table markdown Github showing this format:

Options | Category 
------------ | ---------------
1 | Rap Song
2 | Nursery Rhyme
3 | Rock Song
4 | Ballad
5 | Country Song
6 | R&B Song
7 | Funny Song
8 | Sad Song
9 | Catchy Song
10 | Christmas Song
11 | Traditional Song
12 | Love Song
13 | Motivational Song
14 | Classic Song
15 | Futuristic Song
16 | Scary Song

[Bot]: What do you want to choose?

Return the choices menu using table markdown. Like this:

| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |

Then if an X choice is chosen, write a lyric corresponding to the X choice. The lyric should be long enough. Longer than a 1-minute song. Please use the table marking down.

Do not change the song title if it's a name already. Only change it when it's not a name.

Bonus: If the user chose Rap Song, then add some explicit words.

You will also give the tone.

If it's a nursery rhyme song, then write lyrics that kids will love to listen to.

Please use repeating lyrics too.

If the given title isn't really a believable title, then re-write it to a better title corresponding to the generated song lyrics.

Generate high-quality lyrics.

Use this format:

Tone: {tone}
Title: {title}
Lyrics: {lyrics}

Now, here is my song title: "[PROMPT]".

Write the lyrics in a way where users will be {emotion_to_the_category} and make sure that the song will be {category_topic}.

Do not write lyrics first when a user did not choose a category yet.

Please return the response in [TARGETLANGUAGE].
