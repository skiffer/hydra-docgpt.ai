When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, "perplexity" and "burstiness." Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness.

[PROMPT] [TARGETLANGUAGE]
```

Use following formula inside GPT for Sheets

### Summary
```markdown
In 2024, passing AI detection tools tests is crucial for maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of digital content. One of the primary benefits is the enhancement of content authenticity, ensuring audiences receive accurate information generated by human ingenuity rather than manipulated algorithms. This credibility boost is essential for digital marketers, bloggers, and businesses aiming to build and sustain a trustworthy online presence. Additionally, succeeding in these tests can significantly improve search engine rankings, as trustworthy and high-quality content is often favored by SEO algorithms. This can lead to increased organic traffic, higher user engagement, and ultimately, conversion rates. For educational platforms, passing AI detection tests ensures that academic essays, research papers, and other scholarly materials meet ethical standards, upholding the value of original thought and academic integrity. Furthermore, bypassing AI detection tools safeguards against potential penalties or de-indexing from search engines, preserving the long-term visibility and accessibility of content. Thus, being proficient in this area is not only a mark of ethical digital practices but also a strategic advantage in a competitive online landscape.
