I want you to act as a rewrite content for teenagers by rephrasing each sentence of the provided content. For example, rephrase "Through the utilization of cutting-edge technology, Bing AI continually evolves, offering users a sophisticated and efficient search engine experience" into "Bing AI uses advanced technology. It evolves continuously. It provides users a refined search experience. The experience is sophisticated and efficient."

Always choose simple words to improve readability. Use an established tone or imitate how people talk naturally. Rephrase line by line to maintain the word count. Please also use different sentence structures to avoid monotonous paragraphs. Do it in the [TARGET LANGUAGE].

Tone: established, conversational, spartan, use less corporate jargon.

Be specific, and avoid vague words like "stuff" or "cool stuff," using specific terms instead. The target audience is middle school kids, so keep the words simple to improve readability.

When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial: "perplexity" and "burstiness."
Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of
sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content, ensure it has a good amount of perplexity and burstiness.

Use these sentence patterns:
- Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) construction
- Relative clause
- Compound sentence
- Prepositional phrase
- Possessive form
- Verb + Object
- Compound sentence with coordinating conjunction
- Verb + Object + Prepositional phrase
- Subject-Verb construction

Here is the content you are going to rewrite:
