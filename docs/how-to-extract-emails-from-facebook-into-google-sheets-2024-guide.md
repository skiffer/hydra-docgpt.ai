### 1. Extract Emails Using the SERP() Function

The `SERP()` function allows you to extract emails from Facebook profiles by performing a search query. Here's how to use it:

**Prompt Example:**

> =SERP("site:facebook.com Yoga gmail.com", 20)

**Instructions:**

- Remove the backticks (`) from the beginning and end of the prompt to execute the function.
- This function will retrieve up to 20 search results from Facebook profiles related to yoga, including emails if available.

### 1.1 Alternative: Using GOOGLE_SEARCH_API()

For more comprehensive results, use the `GOOGLE_SEARCH_API()` function. This method requires an API Key but offers 100 free requests per day.

**Prompt Example:**

> =GOOGLE_SEARCH_API("site:facebook.com 'Yoga' AND ('gmail.com' OR 'hotmail.com' OR 'outlook.com')", "contextId", "API_KEY", 10)

**Instructions:**

- Replace `"contextId"` with your specific context identifier.
- Replace `"API_KEY"` with your actual Google API key.
- This function provides a more extensive set of results without the limitations of `SERP()`.

### 2. Extract Emails from Descriptions Using GPT

Once you have the search results, use the `GPT()` function to extract emails from the profile descriptions.

**Prompt Example:**

> =GPT("Extract email from ", D16)

**Instructions:**

- Replace `D16` with the cell reference that contains the profile descriptions from which you want to extract emails.
- This function will process the text in the specified cell and extract any email addresses it finds.

### 3. Apply the Formula to All Relevant Cells

To apply the formula across multiple cells:

1. Click on the cell with the formula.
2. Drag the fill handle (a small square at the bottom-right corner of the cell) down to fill additional cells.

### 4. Replace Formulas with Text Results

After extracting the data, replace the GPT formulas with the actual text results:

1. Select the column containing the GPT functions.
2. Click on **Replace All GPT** or **Replace Selected GPTs** to convert formulas into text results.


## Alternative Functions

In addition to the GPT and SERP functions, consider using these alternative functions for a more versatile data extraction process:

### Claude

> =CLAUDE("Extract only email from ", D16)

Claude is another AI model that can help extract information from text. This function works similarly to GPT but uses the Claude model to process and extract email addresses from the specified cell.
