# Share Your Emails for Access to Organization Subscription

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Prepare a List of Emails
Compile a list of email addresses that should be granted access to the organization's subscription. These emails must be associated with the Google accounts that will use the subscription services.

### 2. Send the List of Emails
Once the list is ready, send it to the following email address: [yaroslav91@gmail.com](mailto:yaroslav91@gmail.com). Ensure that you have included all necessary emails and that they are correctly formatted.

### 3. Admin Grants Access
After submitting your list, the admin will add the provided emails to the organization’s subscription. This will enable the associated accounts.

### 4. Confirm Access
Once the emails have been added, you should receive confirmation from the admin. You will then have access to your organization’s subscription.

### 5. Troubleshooting Access Issues
If you're facing issues accessing the subscription, consider the following:
- Verify that the email sent to [yaroslav91@gmail.com](mailto:yaroslav91@gmail.com) is correct.
- Ensure that the provided email addresses are associated with Google accounts.
- Check with your admin to confirm that the subscription is active.
