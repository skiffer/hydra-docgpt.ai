# The model GPT-4o does not exist or you do not have access to it


To access the pay-per-use API, you must first set up a payment plan and purchase credits. Please refer to the Billing Overview 4.1k for details.

Upon a successful payment (minimum $5), higher rate limits for the GPT-4 model and above will be enabled.

Additionally, disregard the sponsored video suggesting AI can execute code like "showing desktop contents" and manipulating RegEdit. For safety, AI should run Python code within a sandbox environment.

So you need to fill in your OpenAI account or try to use our other plans with our OpenAI API Key with the highest Tier and highest rate limit for enterprise apps from OpenAI.

Plans: Professional, Business
