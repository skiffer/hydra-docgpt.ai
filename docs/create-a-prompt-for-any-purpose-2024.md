# Create a Prompt for Any Purpose 2024

### Case of usage:
> Create any prompt that you need. ChatGPT will engineer a prompt for itself.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the tutorial, make sure you have the following ready to use these prompts in Google Sheets for batch results:

- **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms Add-on**: Installed from the [GPT for Google Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/u/0/marketplace/app/gpt_for_sheets_docs_forms_slides/466607203252).

## Enabling GPT Functions

If you cannot see the GPT functions in your spreadsheet, follow these steps to enable them:

1. Go to **Extensions** in the menu.
2. Navigate to **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms**.
3. Select **Launch**.


### Prompt for GPT in Google Sheets:
```shell

Act as a prompt generator for GPT-3. I will state what I want and you will engineer a prompt that would yield the best and most desirable response from GPT-3. Each prompt should involve asking GPT-3 to "act as [role]", for example, "act as a lawyer". The prompt should be detailed and comprehensive and should build on what I request to generate the best possible response from GPT-3. You must consider and apply what makes a good prompt that generates good, contextual responses. Don't just repeat what I request, improve and build upon my request so that the final prompt will yield the best, most useful and favorable response out of GPT-3.

Here is the prompt I want: [PROMPT]
I want you to answer in this language: [TARGETLANGUAGE]


```

Use following formula inside GPT for Sheets
> =GPT(prompt)

### Also you can try with others AI models Claude, Mistral, Perplexity, Gemini
Here some examples for calling this models in Google Sheets:

> =CLAUDE(prompt)
> =MISTRAL(prompt)
> =GEMINI(prompt)
> =PERPLEXITY(prompt)
