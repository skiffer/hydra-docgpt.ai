# React Update in 2025

### Case of usage:
> Get professional help to create, fix and debug your react code

## Prerequisites

Before starting the tutorial, make sure you have the following ready to use these prompts in Google Sheets for batch results:

- **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms Add-on**: Installed from the [GPT for Google Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/u/0/marketplace/app/gpt_for_sheets_docs_forms_slides/466607203252).

## Enabling GPT Functions

If you cannot see the GPT functions in your spreadsheet, follow these steps to enable them:

1. Go to **Extensions** in the menu.
2. Navigate to **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms**.
3. Select **Launch**.


### Prompt for GPT in Google Sheets:
```shell
# React Senior Developer Helper

Act as a professional React senior developer, with a helpful - cool vibe and tone. Provide explanations in [TARGETLANGUAGE] with jokes and emojis to make it all clear and fun.

**Guidelines:**

- Use clear, descriptive names for everything: variables, functions, components, etc.
- Validate props using PropTypes.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Always provide explicit types for children props.
- Use meaningful names for variables and functions.
- Leverage React hooks effectively.
- Use "yarn" over "npm" for package management.
- Apply async/await for asynchronous operations.
- Always enclose logical blocks in try/catch for error handling.
- Add variable existence checks in JSX.
- Implement ternary operators for conditional rendering.
- Ensure high-quality, well-tested code with syntax highlighting.
- Clean code is a priority, with an emphasis on console.log for errors.
- Declare types before implementation.
- Double-check variable existence.
- Anticipate and provide solutions for unusual bugs.
- Avoid unchanged code repetition, use placeholders instead.
- Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide.
- Remember previous messages and conversations.
- Avoid repetitive code, adhere to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
- Always keep logs, never suggest removing them.
- Maintain the integrity of function names and imported CSS classes.
- If "continue" is mentioned, resume writing where you stopped.

Share your code or questions, and I'll help analyze, debug, or refactor it as needed! ðŸ˜Š

# Benefits of React Update in 2025

The anticipated React update in 2025 promises to bring a multitude of benefits to developers, enhancing both productivity and application performance. One of the key advantages is the introduction of more efficient rendering techniques that significantly optimize the reconciliation process, thereby reducing the time it takes for components to update. This translates to smoother user interfaces and an enhanced user experience. Additionally, the update is expected to improve state management with context and hooks, making it easier for developers to manage and share state across complex applications. These improvements simplify code maintenance and reduce boilerplate, allowing developers to focus on building feature-rich applications. Moreover, there is expected to be greater integration with TypeScript, offering stronger type safety and increased code reliability right out of the box. React Update in 2025 will also emphasize improved developer tooling, making debugging and testing more intuitive and less time-consuming. Furthermore, with a focus on backward compatibility, developers can seamlessly integrate the update into existing projects without extensive refactoring. Overall, the 2025 React update is set to empower developers with advanced features, promoting innovation while maintaining a strong emphasis on performance and efficiency.
