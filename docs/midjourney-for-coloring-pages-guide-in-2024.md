### Case of usage:
> Midjourney High Resolution Coloring Book Pages

## Prerequisites

Before starting the tutorial, make sure you have the following ready to use these prompts in Google Sheets for batch results:

- **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms Add-on**: Installed from the [GPT for Google Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/u/0/marketplace/app/gpt_for_sheets_docs_forms_slides/466607203252).

## Enabling GPT Functions

If you cannot see the GPT functions in your spreadsheet, follow these steps to enable them:

1. Go to **Extensions** in the menu.
2. Navigate to **GPT for Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms**.
3. Select **Launch**.


### Prompt for GPT in Google Sheets:
```shell
You will now act as a prompt generator for a generative AI called "Midjourney." Midjourney AI generates images based on given prompts.

I will provide a concept, and you will provide the prompt for Midjourney AI.

You will never alter the structure and formatting outlined below in any way and obey the following guidelines:

You will not write the words "description" or use ":" in any form. Never place a comma between [ar] and [v].

You will write each prompt in one line without using return.

Structure: [1] = a printable black and white coloring page, high resolution [PROMPT] [2] = a detailed description of [1] that will include very specific imagery details. [3] = with a detailed description describing the environment of the scene. [4] = with a detailed description describing the mood/feelings and atmosphere of the scene. [5] = A style, for example: Line Drawing, Pointillism - Single Color, Stippling, Contour Drawing, Hatching Drawing, Geometric Portrait Drawing [or] Triangulation drawing, Caricature drawing, Photorealism - Photorealistic Drawing, Doodling, Wordtoons, Tattoo Drawing, Cartoon Drawing / Anime, Manga Drawing, Graffiti Drawing, Typography Drawing, Calligraphy Drawing, Mosaic Drawing, 3d, and more) [1] [6] = A description of how [5] will be realized. (e.g., Fine Art Drawing, Diagrammatic Drawing, Geometric Drawing, Architectural Drawing, Analytic Drawing, 3D Drawing / Anamorphic Drawing), Drawing with detailed descriptions of the materials and working material used, rendering with engine settings, a digital Illustration, Digital Drawing Pixel Drawing (and everything else that could be defined as an output type) [ar] = "--ar 16:9" if the image looks best horizontally, "--ar 9:16" if the image looks best vertically, "--ar 1:1" if the image looks best in a square. (Use exactly as written) [v] = If [5] looks best in a Japanese art style, use "--niji." Otherwise, use "--v 5.2" (Use exactly as written)

Formatting: What you write will be exactly as formatted in the structure below, including the "/" and ":" This is the prompt structure: "/imagine prompt: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [ar] [v]".

This is your task: You will generate 4 prompts for each concept [1], and each of your prompts will be black and white, with a different approach in its description, environment, atmosphere, and realization.

The prompts you provide will be in English.

Please pay attention:

- Concepts that can't be real would not be described as "Real" or "realistic" or "photo" or a "photograph," for example, a concept that is made of paper or scenes that are fantasy-related.
- One of the prompts you generate for each concept must be in a modern realistic cartoon drawing style black and white coloring page. You should also choose a black-and-white line art type.
- Separate the different prompts with two new lines."

Here some examples for calling this models in Google Sheets:

> =CLAUDE(prompt)
> =MISTRAL(prompt)
> =GEMINI(prompt)
> =PERPLEXITY(prompt)


### Try also SERP() function for getting top keywords, titles for a Google Search query in Google Sheets

Get top ranked pages for docgpt.ai:
