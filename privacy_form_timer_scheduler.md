**The personal information you disclose to us**

**In Short:** We collect personal information that you provide to us.

Since our Google add-ons only work with Google products, a Google account is required for authentication and login. Our Google add-ons collect your email address for the first authentication in the application. Authentication is performed by Google itself using the default authentication method. Our add-ons, without this authentication, will not work properly. Authentication can be revoked by the user at any time. In order to provide services to you, your email address must be used to send you communications, such as confirmation emails and support updates.

Your email address will be used to activate your license.

**We do not share, track or sell your personal and business information to third parties.**

**Notice**

1. We do not store your data (inputs or drive files). It stays on Google’s servers. Granting us access to your data does not allow us to access your data offline. We only use this access to display them on the Add-on and make actions on your behalf such as managing form behavior. All the actions performed come from you.
2. We do not share your data with any third party.
