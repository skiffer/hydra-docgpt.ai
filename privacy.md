| --- | --- |
| Connect to an external service | We need to request data at external service for getting list of transactions to provide it on your spreadsheet. |

| Display and tun third-party web content in promts and sidebards inside Google applications | To show DocGPT AI Writer menu bar UI. |

### Why does DocGPT AI Writer need those permissions?

DocGPT AI Writer is integrated with G Suite apps like Sheets. It requires access to the Google environment to provide services seamlessly across the G Suite apps. DocGPT AI Writer only requests the minimum-required permissions that are essential for it to function optimally.

DocGPT AI Writer does not have access to your Google account or your password, only to your email  info.

### Can I review or revoke those permissions?

Absolutely. If you need to review the permissions you granted to DocGPT AI Writer, you can do so by going to Google Account -> Third-party apps with account access -> [Manage third-party access](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions?utm_source=google-account&utm_medium=web). There, you can change or revoke the permissions.
