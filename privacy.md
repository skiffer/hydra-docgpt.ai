Our Google add-ons collect your email address for the first authentication in the application. Authentication is performed by Google itself using the default authentication method. Our add-ons, without this authentication, will not work properly. Authentication can be revoked by the user at any time. In order to provide services to you, your email address must be used to send you communications, such as confirmation emails and support updates

Your email address will be used to activate your license.

**We do not share, track or sell your personal and business information to third parties.**

**HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?**

In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
