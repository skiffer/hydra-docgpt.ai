OpenAI has unveiled its latest AI model, codenamed *Strawberry*, and officially named *OpenAI o1*. This new model is part of a family that includes two versions: **o1-preview** and **o1-mini**. While **o1-preview** is a comprehensive model, **o1-mini** is smaller and more efficient, primarily designed for code generation.

## Pricing

ChatGPT Plus and Team users can already access both **o1-preview** and **o1-mini**, with early access for Enterprise and Edu users opening next week. OpenAI also plans to offer **o1-mini** to free ChatGPT users, although the exact release date is yet to be determined.

For developers, **OpenAI o1** comes with a higher price. The API for **o1-preview** is priced at $15 per 1 million input tokens and $60 per 1 million output tokens. In comparison, **GPT-4o** is more cost-effective, at $5 for input tokens and $15 for output tokens.


## Examples of Use Cases

To help further illustrate the differences between these models, here are some examples of how each model can be applied:

### **Example 1: Coding with o1-mini**
If you're a developer working on a complex project that requires generating large blocks of code or handling long multi-step workflows, **o1-mini** is an excellent choice. Its larger token output (up to 65,536 tokens) allows you to generate and execute extensive code snippets with fewer interruptions, making it perfect for **software development** or **data processing** tasks.

### **Example 2: Scientific Research with o1-preview**
Suppose you're a researcher analyzing complex datasets or solving multi-step mathematical problems. In that case, **o1-preview** will provide the **advanced reasoning** capabilities you need to break down intricate tasks, reason through problems, and produce accurate results. This is particularly useful in fields like **biochemistry**, **physics**, or **machine learning research**.

### **Example 3: Creative Projects with GPT-4**
For tasks where **visual content** is integral to your work—such as generating infographics, designing marketing materials, or producing creative content for social media—**GPT-4** is ideal. Its ability to combine text and images makes it the perfect solution for streamlining **creative workflows** in industries like **marketing**, **advertising**, and **content creation**.

## Key Features of OpenAI o1

<div style="text-align: center">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/o1-tokens.png" alt="chatpgt-o1-preview-mini-tokens" class="" style="width: 700px !important;"/>
</div>

One of the standout features of **OpenAI o1** is its ability to "self-reflect." This allows the model to take extra time to process and consider various aspects of a query before providing a response, leading to more thoughtful and accurate answers. This feature is particularly useful for complex tasks that require deep analysis, such as email analysis for privileged information or brainstorming marketing strategies.

The model uses reinforcement learning to "think" before responding, which mimics a thought process. Supported by a system of rewards and penalties, **o1** plans and executes multiple steps to generate a comprehensive response. The theory is that the longer **OpenAI o1** spends processing a query, the better the answer will be.

## Who It's For

The enhanced reasoning capabilities of **OpenAI o1** make it an ideal tool for professionals tackling complex challenges in fields like science, coding, and mathematics. For instance:

- Healthcare researchers can use **o1** to annotate intricate cell sequencing data.
- Physicists can rely on **o1** to generate complex mathematical formulas for quantum optics.
- Developers in various industries can leverage **o1** to create and execute multi-step workflows.

This versatility makes **o1** suitable for anyone working with complex, data-heavy projects requiring higher-level reasoning.

## Performance and Limitations

<div>
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/o1-preview-vs-o1-mini.png" alt="chatpgt-o1-preview-vs-o1-mini" class=""/>
</div>

**OpenAI o1** employs a new optimization algorithm and a specialized training dataset, including scientific literature and reasoning data. During trials, **o1** outperformed **GPT-4o** in several key areas. It successfully solved 83% of the problems in the International Mathematical Olympiad qualifiers (compared to **GPT-4o**'s 13%) and ranked in the 89th percentile in Codeforces programming competitions.

Despite these advances, **o1** has certain limitations:

- Response times can be slower, exceeding 10 seconds for some queries.
- Early testers have reported that **o1** is more prone to "hallucinating" (providing incorrect but confident answers) than **GPT-4o**.
- **o1** is less likely to admit when it doesn’t know the answer.

## Making the Right Choice for Your Needs

When deciding between **ChatGPT o1-preview**, **o1-mini**, and **GPT-4**, it’s important to assess your specific needs:

### Choose **ChatGPT o1-preview** if:
- **Advanced reasoning** is critical for tasks like coding, scientific research, or data analysis that require complex, multi-step problem solving.
- **Speed** is a priority in your workflows, and you need quick, intelligent responses.
- Your focus is primarily on **text-based interactions** without the need for image or visual content generation.

### Choose **ChatGPT o1-mini** if:
- You need a **lightweight and efficient model** for handling tasks with a high token output, especially for **coding** or executing multi-step workflows.
- You’re looking for a model that offers great performance without the full resource requirements of **o1-preview**, but still delivers excellent capabilities for text generation and coding.
- Your project requires a **larger output token limit** (up to 65,536 tokens) to handle more complex data, but without the broader scope of **o1-preview**.

### Choose **ChatGPT 4o** if:

- **Visual content** is critical for your projects, and you need integrated image generation alongside text for tasks like design or content creation.
- You want to **streamline creative workflows** by combining both text and visuals into a single, cohesive platform.
