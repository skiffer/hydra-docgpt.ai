## Quick Formula Reference

The basic OpenRouter formula syntax is:
```
=OPEN_ROUTER(model, apikey, prompt)
```

**Popular model options**:
- `"openai/gpt-4-turbo"` - Best for complex reasoning
- `"anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet"` - Excellent for analysis and writing
- `"google/gemini-pro-1.5"` - Great for multimodal tasks
- `"meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct"` - Cost-effective for general tasks
- `"openai/gpt-3.5-turbo"` - Budget-friendly option

**Common patterns**:
- Simple query: `=OPEN_ROUTER("openai/gpt-4-turbo", "your-api-key", "Write a tagline for coffee shop")`
- With cell reference: `=OPEN_ROUTER("anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet", "your-api-key", "Analyze this data: " & A1)`
- Model comparison: Use different models in adjacent cells to compare outputs

## 5+ Practical Examples

### Example 1: Model Performance Comparison

**Use Case**: Compare different AI models' performance on the same task

**Setup**:
- Column A: Task descriptions/prompts
- Column B: GPT-4 responses
- Column C: Claude responses
- Column D: Gemini responses
- Column E: Llama responses

**OpenRouter Formulas**:
```
B2: =OPEN_ROUTER("openai/gpt-4-turbo", "your-api-key", A2)
C2: =OPEN_ROUTER("anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet", "your-api-key", A2)
D2: =OPEN_ROUTER("google/gemini-pro-1.5", "your-api-key", A2)
E2: =OPEN_ROUTER("meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct", "your-api-key", A2)
```

**Result**: Side-by-side comparison of how different models handle the same task, helping you choose the best model for your specific needs.

### Example 2: Cost-Optimized Content Generation

**Use Case**: Generate content while optimizing for cost and quality

**Setup**:
- Column A: Content types (blog posts, emails, ads)
- Column B: Content requirements
- Column C: Budget tier (economy, standard, premium)
- Column D: Generated content

**OpenRouter Formula**:
```
=OPEN_ROUTER(
  IF(C2="economy", "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
    IF(C2="standard", "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo", 
      "openai/gpt-4-turbo")), 
  "your-api-key", 
  "Create " & A2 & " with these requirements: " & B2
)
```

**Alternative using helper column**:
```
=OPEN_ROUTER(D2, "your-api-key", "Create " & A2 & " with requirements: " & B2)
```
Where D2 contains the model selection logic.

**Result**: Automatically selects the most cost-effective model based on your budget while maintaining quality standards.

### Example 3: Specialized Model Selection

**Use Case**: Use specialized models for different types of tasks

**Setup**:
- Column A: Task categories (code, writing, analysis, creative)
- Column B: Task descriptions
- Column C: Optimized responses

**OpenRouter Formula**:
```
=OPEN_ROUTER(
  IF(A2="code", "deepseek/deepseek-coder-33b-instruct",
    IF(A2="writing", "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet",
      IF(A2="analysis", "openai/gpt-4-turbo",
        "google/gemini-pro-1.5"))),
  "your-api-key",
  B2
)
```

**Result**: Automatically routes tasks to the most suitable specialized model for optimal results.

### Example 4: Multi-Language Content Creation

**Use Case**: Create content in multiple languages using best-in-class models

**Setup**:
- Column A: Content descriptions
- Column B: Target languages
- Column C: Localized content

**OpenRouter Formula**:
```
=OPEN_ROUTER(
  IF(OR(B2="Chinese", B2="Japanese"), "qwen/qwen-2-72b-instruct",
    IF(B2="French", "mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct",
      "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet")),
  "your-api-key",
  "Create content in " & B2 & ": " & A2
)
```

**Result**: Uses models optimized for specific languages and cultural contexts.

### Example 5: Budget-Aware Batch Processing

**Use Case**: Process large datasets while staying within budget constraints

**Setup**:
- Column A: Data to process (customer feedback, reviews, etc.)
- Column B: Processing complexity (simple, medium, complex)
- Column C: Processed results

**OpenRouter Formula**:
```
=OPEN_ROUTER(
  IF(B2="simple", "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo",
    IF(B2="medium", "anthropic/claude-3-haiku",
      "openai/gpt-4-turbo")),
  "your-api-key",
  "Analyze and summarize: " & A2
)
```

**Batch processing with model switching**:
```
=OPEN_ROUTER(
  IF(ROW()<=100, "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo"),
  "your-api-key",
  "Process: " & A2
)
```

**Result**: Optimizes cost by using cheaper models for simple tasks and premium models only when necessary.

### Example 6: Model Fallback and Reliability

**Use Case**: Implement fallback models for high availability

**Setup**:
- Column A: Important prompts
- Column B: Primary model responses
- Column C: Fallback model responses

**OpenRouter Formulas**:
```
B2: =OPEN_ROUTER("openai/gpt-4-turbo", "your-api-key", A2)
C2: =IF(ISERROR(B2), OPEN_ROUTER("anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet", "your-api-key", A2), "Primary model succeeded")
```

**Result**: Ensures high availability by automatically switching to backup models if primary models fail.

## Available Models and Use Cases

3. **Specialize**: Use domain-specific models for specialized tasks
4. **Monitor Costs**: Track spending across different models

### Prompt Optimization for Multiple Models

1. **Model-Agnostic Prompts**: Write prompts that work well across different models
2. **Test Variations**: Some models respond better to different prompt styles
3. **Context Awareness**: Consider each model's strengths and context limits
4. **Temperature Settings**: Experiment with different creativity levels

### Cost Management

1. **Budget Allocation**: Set spending limits per model type
2. **Usage Tracking**: Monitor which models provide best ROI
3. **Batch Processing**: Group similar tasks to optimize API calls
4. **Model Tiers**: Implement tiered model selection based on task importance
