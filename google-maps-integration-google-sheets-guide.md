## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: What types of businesses can I search for?**
A: Google Places API supports dozens of place types including restaurants, retail stores, hospitals, schools, banks, and more. See Google's place types documentation for the complete list.

**Q: How accurate is the location data?**
A: Google Maps data is highly accurate and regularly updated. However, always verify critical information independently for business purposes.

**Q: Can I get historical data about places?**
A: The API provides current data. For historical analysis, you'd need to collect and store data over time using these functions.

### Technical Questions

**Q: How do I get coordinates for my search locations?**
A: Use Google Maps to find coordinates, geocoding services, or address-to-coordinate conversion tools. Coordinates should be in "latitude,longitude" format.

**Q: What's the difference between the two Google Maps functions?**
A: `GOOGLE_MAPS_GET_PLACES()` searches for places by location and type, while `GOOGLE_MAPS_PLACE_GOOGLE()` gets detailed information about a specific place using its Place ID.

**Q: How many places can I search at once?**
A: Each function call returns up to the limit you specify (default 20, max varies by API). You can make multiple calls for larger datasets.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: I'm getting "API key not valid" errors - what should I do?**
A: Check that your API key is correct, the Places API is enabled in your Google Cloud project, and billing is set up if needed.

**Q: Why are some searches returning fewer results than expected?**
A: This could be due to actual business density in the area, restrictive search parameters, or API limitations. Try adjusting radius or keywords.

**Q: How can I handle API quota limits?**
A: Monitor usage in Google Cloud Console, implement caching for repeated searches, and consider upgrading your quota if needed for larger projects.

### Best Practices

**Q: How should I structure my searches for best results?**
A: Use specific place types, appropriate radius settings, and relevant keywords. Test different parameters to optimize for your use case.

**Q: Should I store Place IDs for future use?**
A: Yes, Place IDs are stable identifiers you can use to get updated information about specific places without re-searching.

**Q: How can I verify the accuracy of business information?**
A: Cross-reference with official business websites, call to verify hours and services, and check multiple data sources for critical information.
