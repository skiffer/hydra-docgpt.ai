## Advanced Tips and Best Practices

### Indexing Strategy

2. **Batch Process**: Submit multiple URLs in batches rather than one by one
3. **Monitor Quotas**: Google has daily quotas for indexing API requests
4. **Time Requests**: Space out requests to avoid hitting rate limits

### SEO Optimization

1. **Fresh Content First**: Prioritize recently published or updated content
2. **High-Value Pages**: Focus on pages that drive traffic and conversions
3. **Sitemap Integration**: Use with XML sitemaps for comprehensive coverage
4. **Error Handling**: Monitor for failed requests and retry if necessary

### Monitoring and Analytics

1. **Track Status**: Monitor indexing request status in Search Console
2. **Response Codes**: Check function responses for success/error messages
3. **Indexing Reports**: Use Search Console's Index Coverage report
4. **Performance Impact**: Monitor how indexing affects search performance

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: How long does it take for Google to index my pages after using this function?**
A: Indexing typically occurs within hours to a few days, but Google doesn't guarantee immediate indexing. The function only notifies Google about your content.

**Q: Is there a limit to how many URLs I can submit per day?**
A: Yes, Google has daily quotas for the Indexing API. Monitor your usage in Google Cloud Console to avoid exceeding limits.

**Q: Can I use this for any type of website?**
A: The function works for any website you own and have verified in Google Search Console with proper permissions.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What permissions do I need in Google Search Console?**
A: You need "Owner" permissions for the property. The service account email must be added as an owner in Search Console.

**Q: Why am I getting authentication errors?**
A: Ensure you've completed OAuth authorization and added the service account email to your Search Console property with Owner permissions.

**Q: Can I check if a URL was successfully submitted?**
A: The function returns status information. You can also check the URL Inspection tool in Search Console for indexing status.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: The function returns an error - what should I do?**
A: Common issues include invalid URLs, authentication problems, or quota limits. Check your URL format and API quotas.

**Q: Can I submit URLs for other people's websites?**
A: No, you can only submit URLs for websites you own and have verified in Google Search Console.

**Q: What happens if I submit the same URL multiple times?**
A: Google handles duplicate submissions gracefully, but it's more efficient to avoid unnecessary duplicate requests.

### Best Practices

**Q: Should I submit every page on my website?**
A: Focus on important, frequently updated, or new pages. Google can discover most pages through normal crawling.

**Q: How often should I use the indexing function?**
A: Use it for new content, significant updates, or time-sensitive pages. Avoid excessive submissions of unchanged content.

**Q: Can this replace XML sitemaps?**
A: No, use this as a complement to XML sitemaps. Sitemaps provide comprehensive site structure while indexing API provides immediate notifications.
