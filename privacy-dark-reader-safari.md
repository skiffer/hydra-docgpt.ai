**Last updated: December 7, 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how Dark Reader for Safari. ("we", "our", or "the extension") handles information when you use our Safari browser extension. This policy is designed to comply with Apple's App Review Guidelines and provide complete transparency about our data practices.

## TL;DR - NO DATA COLLECTION

**Dark Reader for Safari. does not collect, transmit, store, or share any of your personal data or browsing information.** The extension operates entirely locally on your device.

## 1. INFORMATION WE DO NOT COLLECT

Dark Reader for Safari. is designed with privacy as a core principle. We explicitly **DO NOT** collect, access, or transmit:

- **Personal Information**: No names, email addresses, or contact information

- **Usage Analytics**: No telemetry, crash reports, or usage statistics
- **Device Information**: No device identifiers, IP addresses, or system information
- **Cookies or Tracking**: No cookies, tracking pixels, or similar technologies
- **Theme Preferences**: Your dark mode settings are stored only on your device

## 2. WHAT THE EXTENSION DOES

Dark Reader for Safari. performs the following operations **entirely on your device**:

### Dark Mode Application
- **Website Access**: The extension accesses web pages you visit to apply dark mode styling
- **CSS Analysis**: Reads page styles to intelligently transform colors from light to dark
- **DOM Manipulation**: Modifies page appearance by injecting dark theme CSS rules
- **Local Processing**: All color transformation logic runs in your browser - no data leaves your device

### Local Storage Usage
- **Settings Storage**: Your preferences (brightness, contrast, color scheme, site-specific settings) are stored locally using Safari's browser storage API
- **Site List Storage**: Your custom site enable/disable list is stored locally on your device
- **Custom Themes**: Any custom color configurations are stored locally only
- **Local Only**: This data never leaves your device and is not synchronized or backed up to any server

## 3. PERMISSIONS EXPLAINED

Dark Reader for Safari. requires the following Safari permissions to function:

| Permission | Purpose | What We Access |

| **Active Tab** | Current site settings | Detect current website for per-site settings |

### Why These Permissions Are Required

- **Website Access**: Required to analyze page colors and apply dark mode transformations. The extension reads CSS styles to intelligently convert light colors to dark equivalents while preserving images and media.
- **Local Storage**: Required to remember your dark mode preferences, brightness/contrast settings, custom colors, and per-site configurations. All data stays on your device.
- **Active Tab**: Required to identify the current website so you can enable/disable dark mode for specific sites and apply site-specific theme settings.
