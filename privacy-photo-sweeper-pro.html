		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>This Privacy Policy describes how "Photo Sweeper AI Pro" ("the App," "we," "us," or "our") handles your information when you use our application for macOS and iOS. We are committed to protecting your privacy. <strong>All data processing occurs locally on your device - we do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on external servers.</strong></p>

		<h2>Information We Access</h2>

		<h3>Photo Library Access</h3>
		<p>With your permission, the App accesses your Photo Library to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Identify Duplicate Photos:</strong> Scan for identical or similar images using on-device comparison algorithms</li>
			<li><strong>Find Similar Photos:</strong> Group photos that look alike for easier review and cleanup</li>
			<li><strong>Display Metadata:</strong> Show photo details such as date, dimensions, file size, and camera information</li>
			<li><strong>Remove Duplicates:</strong> Move selected duplicate photos to the Recently Deleted album upon your confirmation</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Folder Access (macOS)</h3>
		<p>On macOS, you may optionally grant access to specific folders on your computer to scan for duplicate photos outside of the Photo Library. This access is limited to the folders you explicitly choose.</p>

		<h2>How Your Data Is Processed</h2>

			<li>No data is transmitted to our servers or any third-party servers</li>

			<li>Scan results are stored only in the app's local memory during the session</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>No Cloud Processing</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>We do not use cloud-based AI or machine learning services to process your photos</li>
			<li>We do not upload any images or metadata to external servers</li>
