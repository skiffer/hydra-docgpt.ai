## Short answer

Amazon Seller Enrichment in Google Sheets with AI is a practical workflow for Amazon agencies, ecommerce SaaS teams, wholesale vendors, aggregators, and marketplace consultants who already manage lists in Google Sheets. With [GPT for Sheets](/gpt-for-sheets/), you can turn each row into a source-grounded summary, score, extracted signal set, draft outreach angle, and QA flag without moving the list into another tool.

**Fastest path:** [install GPT for Sheets](/gpt-for-sheets/) → add source columns → paste the formulas below → review 10 to 25 rows → fill down → [compare paid plans](/gpt-for-sheets/#pricing) when the workflow is saving time or running at volume. Clay is a trademark of its respective owner. This page is independent and unaffiliated, does not link to or speak for any competitor, and uses "Clay alternative" only to describe a workflow fit: spreadsheet-native enrichment and research inside Google Sheets.

## Workflow {#workflow}

A useful Amazon seller enrichment sheet usually has these columns:

| Column | What to put there | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| A | Lead, account, or company name | Stable row anchor for filtering and CRM handoff |
| B | Source notes | Keeps AI output grounded in visible evidence |
| C | ICP or qualification criteria | Defines what the score should measure |
| D | AI summary | Gives reps or operators quick context |
| E | Extracted signals | Captures category, seller type, fit for your offer, missing evidence, and a respectful outreach angle |
| F | Fit or priority score | Helps sort the list into work queues |
| G | Outreach or next-step angle | Turns research into action while staying reviewable |
| H | QA flag | Catches unsupported claims before export or outreach |

### 1. Keep source evidence next to every output

Start with seller or brand name, marketplace notes, category, product examples, public site text, review snippets, and your ICP criteria. Do not hide these raw columns after enrichment. The biggest advantage of a spreadsheet-native workflow is that a reviewer can compare the AI output with the exact source row before a record reaches CRM, a sales rep, or a campaign.

### 2. Run the sample before filling down

Test the formulas on a small sample with easy rows, messy rows, and edge cases. Review the score reasons, unsupported claims, and QA flags. Tighten the criteria until the output is useful enough for your team, then fill down the rest of the list.

### 3. Turn the sheet into an operating queue

Sort by score, filter for `REVIEW` rows, and assign owners. For high-volume lists, replace formulas with values after review so the sheet stays stable, then export only approved rows to CRM or your outreach workflow.

## Use cases {#use-cases}

- **Amazon agency prospecting:** use GPT for Sheets to summarize evidence, add a priority or fit label, and create a reviewable next action.
- **Marketplace vendor list scoring:** use GPT for Sheets to summarize evidence, add a priority or fit label, and create a reviewable next action.
- **Wholesale partner research:** use GPT for Sheets to summarize evidence, add a priority or fit label, and create a reviewable next action.
- **Aggregator target-account review:** use GPT for Sheets to summarize evidence, add a priority or fit label, and create a reviewable next action.
- **Seller list cleanup before CRM import:** use GPT for Sheets to summarize evidence, add a priority or fit label, and create a reviewable next action.


## Best for / not best for {#best-for-not-best-for}

**Best for:** teams that already have seller rows and need consistent research notes, fit labels, and draft outreach in Google Sheets.

**Not best for:** unsupported revenue estimates, private seller data, or automated claims about seller performance.

**Comparison note:** For public-source seller research, GPT for Sheets can provide a lightweight alternative to a larger GTM workflow. Use a dedicated platform when your process depends on integrated data providers or automated multi-step campaigns.

## Safety, compliance, and QA

Avoid unsupported sales, revenue, ranking, or performance claims. Mark assumptions and review before outreach. More generally, AI output is a decision aid rather than a guaranteed fact. Keep source columns visible, add a QA column, review a representative sample, and follow your data, outreach, privacy, and CRM policies before acting.

## FAQ {#faq}

### Is GPT for Sheets a Clay alternative for Amazon seller enrichment?

It can be a lightweight Clay alternative for Amazon seller enrichment when your goal is spreadsheet-native research, scoring, drafting, and QA. It is independent and unaffiliated with Clay and does not claim feature parity or guaranteed data coverage.

### What data should I put in the sheet first?

Start with stable identifiers and evidence: seller or brand name, marketplace notes, category, product examples, public site text, review snippets, and your ICP criteria. Keep raw source columns visible so reviewers can trace every AI-generated summary or score.

### How many rows should I test before scaling?

Start with 10 to 25 representative rows. Review high scores, low scores, and QA failures, adjust the prompt or criteria, then fill down only after the sample behaves consistently.

### Can I send outreach directly from the AI output?

Treat the output as a draft. Review claims, consent, opt-out requirements, and source evidence before sending email, importing CRM updates, or assigning work to a rep.
