## Short answer

Car Dealer BDC Lead Triage in Google Sheets: A Clay Alternative is a practical workflow for dealer principals, BDC managers, internet sales managers, and automotive marketing agencies who already manage lists in Google Sheets. With [GPT for Sheets](/gpt-for-sheets/), you can turn each row into a source-grounded summary, score, extracted signal set, draft outreach angle, and QA flag without moving the list into another tool.

**Fastest path:** [install GPT for Sheets](/gpt-for-sheets/) → add source columns → paste the formulas below → review 10 to 25 rows → fill down → [compare paid plans](/gpt-for-sheets/#pricing) when the workflow is saving time or running at volume. Clay is a trademark of its respective owner. This page is independent and unaffiliated, does not link to or speak for any competitor, and uses "Clay alternative" only to describe a workflow fit: spreadsheet-native enrichment and research inside Google Sheets.

## Workflow {#workflow}

A useful car dealer BDC lead triage sheet usually has these columns:

| Column | What to put there | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| A | Lead, account, or company name | Stable row anchor for filtering and CRM handoff |
| B | Source notes | Keeps AI output grounded in visible evidence |
| C | ICP or qualification criteria | Defines what the score should measure |
| D | AI summary | Gives reps or operators quick context |
| E | Extracted signals | Captures intent, urgency, vehicle match, appointment/no-show risk, and the next best staff action |
| F | Fit or priority score | Helps sort the list into work queues |
| G | Outreach or next-step angle | Turns research into action while staying reviewable |
| H | QA flag | Catches unsupported claims before export or outreach |

### 1. Keep source evidence next to every output

Start with CRM export fields, vehicle of interest, lead source, appointment status, trade-in notes, last activity, and staff notes. Do not hide these raw columns after enrichment. The biggest advantage of a spreadsheet-native workflow is that a reviewer can compare the AI output with the exact source row before a record reaches CRM, a sales rep, or a campaign.

### 2. Run the sample before filling down

Test the formulas on a small sample with easy rows, messy rows, and edge cases. Review the score reasons, unsupported claims, and QA flags. Tighten the criteria until the output is useful enough for your team, then fill down the rest of the list.

### 3. Turn the sheet into an operating queue

Sort by score, filter for `REVIEW` rows, and assign owners. For high-volume lists, replace formulas with values after review so the sheet stays stable, then export only approved rows to CRM or your outreach workflow.

## Use cases {#use-cases}

- **Morning BDC lead queue prioritization:** use GPT for Sheets to summarize evidence, add a priority or fit label, and create a reviewable next action.
- **No-show follow-up prep:** use GPT for Sheets to summarize evidence, add a priority or fit label, and create a reviewable next action.
- **Trade-in note summarization:** use GPT for Sheets to summarize evidence, add a priority or fit label, and create a reviewable next action.
- **Internet lead handoff to sales staff:** use GPT for Sheets to summarize evidence, add a priority or fit label, and create a reviewable next action.
- **Agency QA before campaign reporting:** use GPT for Sheets to summarize evidence, add a priority or fit label, and create a reviewable next action.


## Best for / not best for {#best-for-not-best-for}

**Best for:** dealership teams that review lead exports in Sheets and want a fast prioritization layer before staff outreach.

**Not best for:** automated credit, financing, desking, or compliance decisions; those require dealership systems and human review.

**Comparison note:** BDC teams often need a lightweight review layer more than a large enrichment platform. GPT for Sheets can summarize and score exported rows while keeping the original CRM evidence visible.

## Safety, compliance, and QA

Do not claim financing eligibility, creditworthiness, or vehicle availability unless verified in dealership systems. Use AI notes as staff prompts only. More generally, AI output is a decision aid rather than a guaranteed fact. Keep source columns visible, add a QA column, review a representative sample, and follow your data, outreach, privacy, and CRM policies before acting.
