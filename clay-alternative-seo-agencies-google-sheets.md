## Short answer

Clay Alternative for SEO Agencies: Prospect and Enrich Leads in Google Sheets is a spreadsheet-native way for SEO agencies, link-building teams, and growth consultants to turn domain, niche, traffic notes, target service, and source URL into site-fit summary, audit angle, outreach hook, priority score. Instead of researching one row at a time, GPT for Sheets lets you run row-based AI formulas across a prospect, catalog, account, or research table and keep the output reviewable.

**Fastest path:** [Install GPT for Sheets](/gpt-for-sheets/) → add source columns → paste a formula from the formula section → review 10 sample rows → fill down the sheet.

## Workflow

Build the sheet so every output can be traced back to source data. A practical table for SEO agency lead research includes:

| Column | What to put there | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| A | Primary record: company, person, product, domain, or account | Gives the formula a stable row anchor |
| B | Source notes or snippets | Keeps AI grounded in text you can inspect |
| C | Target persona, market, or segment | Makes output specific instead of generic |
| D | Offer, criteria, or goal | Aligns the prompt with your sales or research motion |
| E | AI summary | Creates a fast row-level brief |
| F | Score or label | Helps filter and prioritize |
| G | Outreach, action, or recommendation | Turns research into execution |
| H | QA flag | Forces review before import, sending, or decisions |

### Step-by-step setup

1. Start with 10 representative rows rather than the full sheet.
2. Write one formula that references `A2`, `B2`, `C2`, and `D2`.
3. Compare the output with the source notes and tighten the prompt.
4. Add a QA formula that asks for missing facts, risky claims, and a review label.
5. Fill down only after the sample rows are useful.
6. Export or paste results into your CRM, outreach tool, catalog system, or report only after human review.

## Copyable formula notes

The formula cards above are designed to be pasted into row 2 and dragged down. Replace `=GPT` with the model-specific function you use inside GPT for Sheets if your workspace uses provider-specific formulas. Keep prompts concrete: ask for a score, evidence, uncertainty, and a manual-review note rather than a vague paragraph.

## Use cases

- **Bulk research:** turn raw rows into concise summaries your team can scan.
- **Prioritization:** create fit, urgency, or opportunity labels before deeper manual work.
- **Personalization:** draft first lines or campaign angles from row-specific source notes.
- **Data cleanup:** normalize messy notes into consistent fields for review.
- **QA:** flag missing source context, unsupported claims, and rows that need a human.

## Best for / not best for

**Best for:** SEO agencies, link-building teams, and growth consultants who already work in Google Sheets and need faster, reviewable AI output across many rows.

**Not best for:** teams that need guaranteed proprietary data, legal/compliance decisions without human review, or a fully managed platform outside Sheets.

Best when agency researchers want flexible prompts inside existing prospect sheets. Not best when the agency needs dedicated enrichment waterfalls, native email verification, or a separate campaign platform.

## Safety, compliance, and data quality

Clay is a third-party trademark. GPT for Sheets is not affiliated with Clay and does not claim to provide the same proprietary datasets; this is a spreadsheet-native AI research workflow.

For any high-stakes workflow, keep the source columns visible, store dates and URLs where relevant, and make the final decision outside the AI formula. A simple `pass / review / fail` QA column will prevent many bad imports and unsupported outreach claims.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the fastest way to start SEO agency lead research in Google Sheets?

Install GPT for Sheets, add your source columns, paste one formula into row 2, review the output, then fill it down only after the prompt is accurate for sample rows.

### Do I need to copy and paste between ChatGPT and Google Sheets?

No. GPT for Sheets lets you run AI formulas directly in spreadsheet cells, which is better for bulk prompts, repeatable QA columns, and reviewed exports.

### Can I use different AI models or providers?

Yes. GPT for Sheets is built for spreadsheet AI workflows across supported models/providers, so you can test outputs and keep the best prompt for the job.

### Should I trust every AI output automatically?

No. Treat AI output as a draft. Keep source columns, confidence notes, and QA formulas so a human can review important claims before outreach, import, or decisions.
