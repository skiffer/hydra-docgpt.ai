## Short answer

Small Business Enrichment Tool for Google Sheets is a spreadsheet-native workflow for small business owners, founders, local agencies, and lean sales teams. Instead of researching one row at a time or copying notes between tools, GPT for Sheets lets you run AI formulas across a full table of business name, website, category, city, source note, target customer, and offer and produce company summaries, category labels, fit scores, outreach notes, and missing-data flags in adjacent columns.

**Fastest path:** [Install GPT for Sheets](/gpt-for-sheets/) → add your source columns → paste a formula from the formula section → review 10 rows → fill down the sheet. For pricing and plan details, go directly to [GPT for Sheets pricing](/gpt-for-sheets/#pricing).

This page is built for purchase-intent users who already know the value of spreadsheet workflows but need a faster way to research, score, clean, summarize, and personalize rows at scale.

## Workflow

A practical sheet for this workflow usually has these columns:

| Column | What to put there | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| A | Primary record: company, person, lead, listing, product, account, keyword, or URL | Gives the formula a stable row anchor |
| B | Source notes, snippets, CRM export, review text, or website copy | Keeps AI grounded in inspectable evidence |
| C | Segment, persona, market, territory, or target use case | Makes the output specific instead of generic |
| D | Offer, criteria, compliance note, or goal | Aligns the prompt with sales or operations |
| E | AI research summary | Creates the first useful interpretation |
| F | Score, category, or priority | Helps filter and prioritize |
| G | Outreach, recommendation, or next action | Turns research into execution |
| H | QA flag | Prevents unsupported claims from moving forward |

### Step-by-step setup

1. Start with 10 representative rows before filling down hundreds or thousands of rows.
2. Keep raw source fields unchanged in columns A-D.
3. Use one formula to create a summary or score, then inspect weak rows.
4. Add constraints: max length, output format, target persona, and what to do if data is missing.
5. Add a QA formula that asks for missing facts, unsupported assumptions, and a review label.
6. Fill down after the prompt works on sample rows.

### Why run this in a spreadsheet?

A spreadsheet workflow keeps the source data, prompt, AI output, score, and QA flag visible in adjacent columns. That matters when a team needs to review sample rows, adjust the prompt, fill down only after the output is useful, and export clean rows to a CRM, email tool, report, or client deliverable.

## Copyable formula notes

The formula cards above are designed to be pasted into row 2 and dragged down. Replace `=GPT` with the model-specific function you use inside GPT for Sheets if your workspace uses provider-specific formulas. Keep prompts concrete: ask for a score, evidence, uncertainty, and a manual-review note rather than a vague paragraph.

## Use cases

- **Turn** a CSV of prospects into reviewable notes.
- **Classify** companies and categories consistently.
- **Score** rows before manual follow-up.
- **Draft** simple next actions from source notes.

## Best for / not best for

**Best for:** small teams that live in spreadsheets and want useful AI enrichment without extra software overhead.

**Not best for:** guaranteed proprietary data, legal decisions, or complex enterprise data governance.

The strongest use case is when you already have rows in a spreadsheet and need structured AI outputs. If your core problem is buying a specific proprietary database, use GPT for Sheets as the analysis, cleanup, and personalization layer after export.

## Safety, compliance, and data quality

Outputs are drafts. Verify important business facts and do not promise complete enrichment coverage. For any high-stakes workflow, treat AI output as a structured draft. Keep source columns visible, store source URLs or dates when relevant, and make the final decision outside the AI formula. A simple `pass / review / fail` QA column helps prevent bad imports, unsupported outreach claims, and accidental over-automation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the fastest way to start small business enrichment tool for google sheets?

Install GPT for Sheets, add source columns, paste one formula into row 2, review a small sample, then fill down after the prompt is reliable.

### Do I need to copy and paste between ChatGPT and Google Sheets?

No. GPT for Sheets lets you run AI formulas directly in spreadsheet cells, which is better for repeatable bulk prompts, scoring columns, and QA review.

### Should I trust every AI output automatically?

No. Treat AI output as a draft. Keep source columns visible and use QA formulas to flag missing facts, weak evidence, and unsupported claims.

## Start this workflow in Google Sheets

If your team already lives in spreadsheets, the fastest way to operationalize this workflow is to install GPT for Sheets and run the formulas directly where your rows already live.
